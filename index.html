    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      As a QA (Quality Assurance) Engineer, I possess a strong background in
      software testing and quality control. My expertise includes developing and
      executing test plans to ensure software functionality and performance,
      identifying and documenting defects, and working closely with development
      teams to resolve issues. With a keen eye for detail and a commitment to
      delivering high-quality software products, I excel in both manual and
      automated testing environments. My strong analytical skills, coupled with
      a thorough understanding of software development life cycles, enable me to
      effectively contribute to the improvement of product quality. I am
      continuously seeking to enhance my skills and knowledge, aiming to become
      a specialist in QA and Automated QA (AQA), and am adept at adapting to new
      technologies and methodologies in the rapidly evolving field of software
      engineering. My experience in diverse projects, combined with a
      collaborative and proactive approach, makes me a valuable asset to any
      team aiming for excellence in software development and quality assurance.
