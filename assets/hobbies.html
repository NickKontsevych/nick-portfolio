        <p>
          I enjoy playing Warhammer Kill Team for its strategic depth, diverse
          factions, and the thrill of close-quarters skirmishes in a richly
          detailed sci-fi universe.

        <p>
          I enjoy drawing because it allows me to express creativity, capture my
          imagination visually, and find tranquility in the act of creating art.
